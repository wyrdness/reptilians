      "summary": "Conspiracy theory alleging reptilian humanoid aliens secretly control Earth, particularly through shapeshifting into positions of power. Promoted mainly by David Icke since the 1990s.",
      "full": "The Reptilian conspiracy theory alleges that reptilian humanoid aliens secretly control Earth and humanity. Popularized by British conspiracy theorist David Icke from the 1990s onward, the theory claims these beings can shapeshift to appear human and have infiltrated the highest levels of power, including royal families, politicians, and the so-called 'Illuminati.' The reptilians are portrayed as malevolent entities manipulating human society. The concept has roots in 1930s pulp science fiction but gained conspiracy traction in Icke's work. The theory has been widely criticized for containing antisemitic tropes, particularly in its targeting of banking families and global elites. No credible evidence supports the existence of reptilian aliens. The theory is considered a harmful conspiracy belief that has influenced real-world actions and violence."
