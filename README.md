## Overview

The Reptilian conspiracy theory alleges that reptilian humanoid aliens secretly control Earth and humanity. Popularized by British conspiracy theorist David Icke from the 1990s onward, the theory claims these beings can shapeshift to appear human and have infiltrated the highest levels of power, including royal families, politicians, and the so-called "Illuminati."

The reptilians are portrayed as malevolent entities manipulating human society. The concept has roots in 1930s pulp science fiction but gained conspiracy traction in Icke's work, particularly his 1999 book *The Biggest Secret*.

**The theory has been widely criticized for containing antisemitic tropes**, particularly in its targeting of banking families and global elites. No credible evidence supports the existence of reptilian aliens. The theory is considered a harmful conspiracy belief that has influenced real-world actions and violence.

## "Evidence" Analysis

### Video Claims

**Alleged "shapeshifting" videos**: Numerous videos claim to show reptilian features briefly visible.

**Reality**: All such videos have been debunked as:
- Video compression artifacts
- Lighting effects and shadows
- Pareidolia (seeing patterns where none exist)
- Deliberate hoaxes

**Conclusion**: Zero genuine evidence.

### Physical Evidence

**None exists.**

### Testimonial Evidence

Claims come exclusively from conspiracy theorists. No credible witnesses, no verifiable accounts, no consistent testimonies.

---

## Debunking & Analysis

### Science Fiction Origins

**Clear parallels to fictional narratives**:
- *V* (1983-1985): Reptilian aliens disguised as humans
- *They Live* (1988): Hidden aliens controlling society
- Pulp science fiction (1930s-1940s): Reptilian alien species

**Timeline correlation**: Conspiracy theory emerged after these influential media sources.

### Antisemitic Concerns

> ⚠️ **Critical Issue**: Scholars and anti-defamation organizations have identified antisemitic elements in the reptilian conspiracy theory.

**Problematic elements**:
- Targeting of banking families (historical antisemitic trope)
- "Secret control" narratives (parallels blood libel and Protocols of Zion)
- "Shapeshifting" as metaphor for perceived deception
- Conspiracy about global elites

**Academic consensus**: The theory recycles antisemitic conspiracy tropes with an alien overlay.

### Psychological Explanation

**Why people believe**:
- **Pattern recognition**: Humans are wired to see patterns
- **Pareidolia**: Seeing faces/features in random stimuli
- **Confirmation bias**: Interpreting evidence to fit beliefs
- **Need for explanatory narratives**: Complex world events simplified
- **Video compression artifacts**: Misinterpreted as "evidence"

### Scientific Impossibility

**Biological impossibility**:
- No evolutionary pathway for humanoid reptiles
- Reptilian and mammalian biology fundamentally incompatible
- "Shapeshifting" violates physics and biology
- No genetic evidence whatsoever

**Physical impossibility**:
- No spacecraft detected
- No underground bases found
- No technology recovered
- Zero physical evidence of any kind
